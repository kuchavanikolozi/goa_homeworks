# We need to input an integer to the user and store it in a variable.
# Let's also take a new variable and store the value of the first variable as a decimal.
# Finally, let's compare these two numbers with the == operator and output them to the terminal.

# number = int(input("Please input an integer number: "))
# number2 = float(number)

# print(number == number2)

# We need to compile 5 instances of the > operator

# print(5 > 5)
# print(8 > 3)
# print(12 > 21)
# print(23 > 6)
# print(54 > 98)

# We need to compile 5 instances of the < operator

# print(65 < 23)
# print(34 < 78)
# print(98 < 41)
# print(23 < 21)
# print(43 < 70)

# We need to compile 5 instances of the >= operator

# print(23 >= 12)
# print(56 >= 34)
# print(66 >= 66)
# print(28 >= 33)
# print(44 >= 12)

# We need to compile 5 instances of the <= operator

# print(77 <= 13)
# print(43 <= 90)
# print(23 <= 56)
# print(31 <= 4)
# print(123 <= 234)

# We need to compile 5 instances of the == operator

# print(89 == 123)
# print(76 == 45)
# print(287 == 140)
# print(331 == 212)
# print(990 == 443)


# We need to compile 5 instances of the != operator

# print(67 != 23)
# print(34 != 42)
# print(23 != 85)
# print(76 != 34)
# print(99 != 21)

#We need to provide the user with two numbers and compare them with all the learned operators.

# number3 = int(input("Please input an number: "))
# number4 = int(input("Please input an another number: "))

# print(number3 > number4)
# print(number3 < number4)
# print(number3 >= number4)
# print(number3 <= number4)
# print(number3 == number4)
# print(number3 != number4)

#We need to provide the user with number and compare that number with all the learned operators.

# number5 = int(input("Please input an number: "))

# print(number5 > number5)
# print(number5 < number5)
# print(number5 >= number5)
# print(number5 <= number5)
# print(number5 == number5)
# print(number5 != number5)

#We need to introduce a number to the user and compare it to a number 10 greater than it using all the learned operators.

# number6 = int(input("Please input an number: "))

# print(number6 > 20)
# print(number6 < 20)
# print(number6 >= 20)
# print(number6 <= 20)
# print(number6 == 20)
# print(number6 != 20)

#We need to enter the user an integer in the first input, and a decimal in the second input, Finally, let's check the data types of the variable values with the == and != operators.

# number7 = int(input("Please input an integer number: "))
# number8 = float(input("Please input an float number: "))

# print(number7 == number8)
# print(number7 != number8)
